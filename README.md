# Scikonaut

Scikonaut provides a framework for conducting experiements with a focus on self-experimentation. It allows users to "drop in" web apps which represent experiments and exposes an API for storing data collected from the experiments. Scikonaut then provides numerous tools with human-friendly interfaces for analyzing the collected data.
